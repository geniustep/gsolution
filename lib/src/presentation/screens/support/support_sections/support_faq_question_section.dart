            "Inventory management is the process of overseeing and controlling the flow of goods into and out of a company's inventory. It involves tracking inventory levels, ordering and restocking inventory, and optimizing inventory turnover to ensure that goods are available when needed without excess stockpiling."),

            "Inventories can be classified into several types including raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), finished goods, and MRO (maintenance, repair, and operating supplies). Additionally, inventory can be categorized based on its value, such as ABC classification (high, medium, and low-value items)."),

            "Safety stock is the extra inventory a company keeps on hand to mitigate the risk of stockouts due to unexpected fluctuations in demand or supply chain disruptions. It acts as a buffer to ensure that products are available even when demand exceeds expectations or when there are delays in replenishment."),

            "Optimizing inventory levels involves balancing the costs associated with holding inventory (such as storage costs, obsolescence, and carrying costs) with the costs of stockouts or lost pos_sales. This can be achieved through techniques such as demand forecasting, economic order quantity (EOQ) calculations, and just-in-time (JIT) inventory management."),
